- in regular functions you provide an input and the function returns an output
    - in ML you provide both, and the function has to figure out how to achieve the output
- 3 types of ML:
    - supervised: data already have categories. you can decide how to classify
    - unsupervised: doesn't have categories, i.e. a csv file without column name. the machine determines the classification
    - reinforcement: teaching machines through trials and errors


#1 - Import the data
#2 - Clean the data - #1 and #2 probably the most difficult steps given the competitive advantage they mean
#3 - Split the data. Training set/Test set
#4 - Create a model
#5 - Check the output
#6 - Improve



- python has the best tools for ML
    - NumPy - list and arrays
    - pandas - work on tabular data like csv files
    - scikit-learn (sklearn) - create models
    - matplotlib - charting, visualize
    - jupyter notebooks - step through code and keep track of things done
    - kaggle - community and datasets
